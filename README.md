# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Project Overview

This project involves building a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits ranging from 0 to 9, and it is a popular benchmark for image classification tasks in machine learning. The project covers the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment for predictions.

## Dataset

### MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size and is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9). The dataset is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

### Dataset Source

The MNIST dataset is provided by Yann LeCun and is publicly available for academic research. It can be easily accessed via the Keras library.
